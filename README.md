# image_classification_with_CNN_using_tensorflow
This project demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) powered by TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories, leveraging the power of deep learning to automatically extract features and learn patterns from image data.
